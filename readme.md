About
---

Hypersonic is a platform for developing data-centric business applications.. So, what is this?
It's any application which the primary goal is to allow the user to manipulate entities. It allows users to input
data, search and compile the information into charts and reports. It's a management system. The entities that the users manipulate depend on the
application niche. If we're talking about a CRM, for instance, there will probably be entities for Customer, Organization, Lead and Sale.
The universe of entities that the user can manipulate is called the `Application Domain`.
  
Fortunately, virtually every *data-centric business application* share most of their DNA, 
regardless of the application domain. It doesn't matter which entities the application handles, there's
always a plethora of common problems that have to be tackled:
 
 - Authentication.
 - Authorization / Access Control.
 - API and integration.
 - Auditing / Change Tracking.
 - Notifications.
 - Dynamic SCRUD forms (search, create, read, update and delete).
 - Custom entities and forms.
 - Charts.
 - Reports.
   
Hypersonic aims to provide the tools you need to create a successful application without having to deal with all these
hurdles.
 
Core concepts
---

**Configuration over coding**

As mentioned before, *data-centric business applications* share a common DNA. Most of the business logic should be
 handled by the platform, not the application. Hypersonic provides a framework that allows for *configuring* rather than
 *coding* for most of the scenarios.
 
Hypersonic relies heavily on *declarative reactive metadata*. Instead of coding, it's possible to *define* the existence of entities
as well as all of it's metadata. It's possible, for instance, to declare that an entity's property is invalid when a give
expression is true. The UI reacts automatically accordingly.

**Extreme customization**

In today's scenario, it's impossible to think of a *data-centric business application* that doesn't allow the customer
to extend it. Hypersonic is designed, from the core, to allow for maximum customization. Actually, the application developer
and the end-user share virtually the same capabilities.  

**Internationalization**

Hypersonic is designed to support translations, time-zones and multiple date and number formats.
