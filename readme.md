About

Gearz is not a library, nor a framework. It is a platform. One important thing to understand is that Gearz is not 
suited for any type of applications, it is a platform for creating *data-centric business applications*. So, what is this?
It's any application which the primary goal is to allow the user to manipulate entities. It allows users to input
data, search and compile the information into charts and reports. It's a management system. The entities that the users manipulate depend on the
application niche. If we're talking about a CRM, for instance, there will probably be entities for Customer, Organization, Lead and Sale.
The universe of entities that the user can manipulate is called the `Application Domain`.
  
Fortunately, virtually every *data-centric business applications* share most of it's DNA, 
regardless of the application domain. It doesn't matter which entities you wish to allow your users to manipulate, there's
always a plethora of common problems that have to be tackled:
 
 - Authentication
 - Authorization / Access Control
 - API and integration
 - Auditing / Change Tracking
 - Dynamic SCRUD forms (search, create, read, update and delete)
 - Charts
 - Reports
   
Gearz aims to provide you with the tools you need to create a successful application without having to deal with all these
hurdles.
