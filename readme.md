About Gearz
---

Gearz is not a library, nor a framework. It is a platform on top of which you can develop applications. Gearz is not 
suited for any type of applications, it is a platform for *data-centric business applications* (DCBA). So, what is a data-centric
business app? It's an application that users can use to manipulate entities. It's a management system. Users can input
data, search and compile the information into charts and reports. The entities that the users manipulate depend on the
niche. If w're talking about a CRM, for instance, there will probably be entities for Customer, Organization, Lead and Sale.
The universe of entities that the user can manipulate is called the `Application Domain`.
  
Fortunately, virtually every *data-centric business applications* application share most of it's DNA, 
regardless of the application domain. It doesn't matter which entities you wish to allow your users to manipulate, there's
always a plethora of common problems that have to be tackled:
 
 - Authentication
 - Authorization / Access Control
 - API and integration
 - Auditing / Change Tracking
 - Dynamic SCRUD forms (search, create, read, update and delete)
 - Charts
 - Reports
   
Gearz aims to provide you with the tools you need to create a successful application without having to deal with all these
hurdles.
